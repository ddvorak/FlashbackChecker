This is a super simple script that looks for files that flashback trojan adds to your computer.  
To run the file simply open terminal and cd to the folder you downloaded flashbackchecker.sh to, and type:

./flashbackchecker.sh


If NO ERRORS SHOW UP:
  You are infected

If ERRORS SHOW UP FOR BOTH COMMANDS:
  You are not infected.... YAY!
